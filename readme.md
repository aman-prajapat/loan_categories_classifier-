# XGBoost Model Prediction Pipeline

This repository contains a script to preprocess data, predict values using a pre-trained XGBoost model, and save the results.
The script reads data from an Excel file, preprocesses it, makes predictions, and outputs the results to a CSV file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Required libraries: `pandas`, `xgboost`, `pickle`, `json`, `sys`

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required libraries using `pip`:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas xgboost
   ```
3. Ensure you have the following files in the `labels_and_model` directory:
   - `xgboost_model.pkl`: Pre-trained XGBoost model.
   - `finalColumnsName.pkl`: List of final column names after preprocessing.
   - `CatColumnsAndlabels.json`: JSON file with categorical columns and their labels.
   - `education_mapping.json`: JSON file with the mapping of education levels.

## Usage

To run the script and make predictions, use the following command:

```bash
python script.py <path_to_input_excel_file>
```

### Example

```bash
python script.py data/input_data.xlsx
```

## Script Breakdown

### 1. `preprocess(filepath)`

- **Input:** Path to the input Excel file.
- **Process:** 
  - Reads the input Excel file into a DataFrame.
  - Applies educational level mapping.
  - Encodes categorical features using one-hot encoding.
- **Output:** Encoded DataFrame ready for prediction.

### 2. `predict(data)`

- **Input:** Preprocessed DataFrame.
- **Process:** 
  - Selects the relevant columns as per the pre-trained model requirements.
  - Uses the XGBoost model to predict values.
- **Output:** Series of predicted values.

### 3. `saveToFile(predicted_values, filepath)`

- **Input:** Predicted values and path to the input Excel file.
- **Process:** 
  - Reads the raw input data.
  - Concatenates the raw data with the predicted values and their corresponding categories.
  - Saves the result to `final_data.csv` in the root directory.
- **Output:** Saves the output CSV file.

## Error Handling

- The script is enclosed in a try-except block to catch and display any errors that occur during execution.

## Final Output

- The script outputs `final_data.csv` in the root directory, which includes:
  - Original data from the input file.
  - Predicted values.
  - Corresponding categories for the predicted values.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure the input Excel file is properly formatted and contains the required columns for preprocessing and prediction.
- The script prompts to press Enter to exit after completion.
